This is for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

##Overview:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The data used in this project is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description of the data can be found at:

Here are the data for the project:

##How to use this R script:

There are 5 files in this repo:
1.README.md
2.CodeBook.md--which describes the variables, the data, and transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
3.run_analysis.R--script for performing the data cleaning analysis
4.tidy_data_set--The result tidy data set

Once you have obtained and unzipped the source files, you need to set the path of the working directory to relect the location of the source files in your own directory.
